tell me everything you know about Parris tech services and what services I offer, because I am wanting to make an app that helps me with individual appointments when there is no specific goal in mind for the client, but they have either a windows or mac computer, or an android or iphone, and they want a checkup, they usually want it to run faster, have more space, be educated on how it works, everything a tech "checkup" involves, like a car service but a tech service

So far I am wanting to develop two distinct browser html based apps, one called

ParrisTechServicesApp and all in one stop for every aspect of Parris tech services from invoicing to scheduling appointments, linking to mywebsites ect

the second app ParrisTechApp I want to be more specific for individual appointments, e.g. the client comes I click "client arrived" and then it has checkboxes for what device/s they have and what sorts of tech related questions they have, then the app tailors what I ask and check depending on which tech questions they have any what devices they own, e.g. if they had all 4 a imac, iphone, android phone and windows laptop, i woudl do everyting

if they just had a windows laptop and not much else, it would be a checklist of everything I need to go through to make their devices the best they can run for their purposes

For example I have Kate Staley visiting Bendigo for a Parris Tech checkup at 4-6pm today, I want to make the best use of our time together

Write prompt 1 for both apps, ParrisTechServicesApp and ParrisTechApp please

What a “tech checkup” should cover (like a car service)

This is perfect for your ParrisTechApp as a guided flow:

1) Goals + safety first (5 mins)

“What bugs you most: slow, storage, pop-ups, emails, photos, printing, Wi-Fi, passwords?”

Confirm backups + get consent before changes.

2) Performance

Startup/login speed, background apps, browser health, updates, disk health.

3) Storage

Biggest files, downloads, duplicate photos, cloud sync status, uninstall bloat, safe cleanup.

4) Security

Updates, AV status, suspicious extensions, password hygiene, 2FA, scam education.

5) Reliability

Backup plan (external drive + cloud), restore test, device health checks.

6) Teach-as-you-go

2–3 “how it works” mini-lessons tailored to them (files/folders, cloud, email, photos, updates).

7) End-of-visit

Simple written summary: what we did, what to watch, next steps, optional follow-up.
